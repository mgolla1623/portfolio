//TO DO
/*
1. Figure out how to make experience look better. how to better show this? sepearte into sections? maybe once i get more work experience idk
    also add images to the expeirence if possible
2. personal section: 
    - Travel: include the video i made from my spam. have a list of diffrent places i have been to (omg interactice map)
    - Food: Link my beli AND my instagram food account
    - Reads: how can i develop a fun bookshelf find of page
3. i want to change fonts/themes to make it more personal and more like me
4. for the personal section, there is a weird gap in betwen the sections!!
5. maybe make buttons in center?

Ideas:
experience - make it so it's intuitive to click on each one and when it's clicked ,THEN the bullet point sshow up+ the extra infromation!!  
i  also want a space to add the logo for the images!!

FIGURE OUT how to put te buttends (email, github,linkedin) in van gar where it is clean and makes sense

i kind of what to list projects a bit differentely as well. like more CLEAN and miminal. 
similar to experience section where if u click on the square, it will expand the block into what it currently looks like. (immage+title -click-> image+tite+descriptions+techlinks)


BUT I DONT KNOW!!
Goal: make it look cleaner, a bit unique, but intuite
for the personal section, there is a weird gap in betwen the sections!!
